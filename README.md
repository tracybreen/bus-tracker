# Bus Tracker

This program utilizes JavaScript and MapBox to show all bus stops on the main route between the MIT and Harvard campuses. When the button is clicked, the stationary marker begins to move across the map, pausing at each location where the bus has a scheduled stop.

## How to Run

Load the index.html file in your browser. Once the map has loaded, click the button at the top of the page to begin the animation.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Add real-time bus tracking functionality using integrated GPS data from public databases.

Employ public data from Philadelphia to track buses in my own city.

Add front-end user input options to change between multiple routes and/or map styles/overlays.
